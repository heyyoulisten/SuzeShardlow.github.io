**About the interview**

Someone who had seen my COED:CODE talk introduced me to Creative Director, Renée Vaughan Sutherland, who invited me to be a guest on her podcast.  The interview covered what coding is and what makes it a creative industry.  We also explored how I fuel my creativity and how I put together my coding projects.

**About the podcast series**

In September 2018, Renée launched Greater than 11%, a podcast all about creative roles, journeys and opportunities.  It was sparked by a statistic she heard at an event in May 2018 that, at that point in time, only 11% of Creative Directors within the media industry were women.

To try to increase that figure, Renée decided to create a free resource to showcase women in the creative industries.  She reasoned that "if you aren’t aware of what roles, careers paths or jobs are out there, then you can’t ever aspire or work towards inhabiting them – and that is even before entering the battleground of opportunity".
