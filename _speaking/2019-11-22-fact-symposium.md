**Talk abstract**

When you enter the tech industry, you soon realise that meetups are a Thing. Groups gather every night of the week in every major city in the world and share IT ideas and knowledge over pizza and beers.

Statistics, by their very nature, vary - but, by any measure, tech is dominated by white men and has been for decades.  There are, however, thousands of women, people of colour and other minorities in the industry.  And there are countless community groups catering to their needs.

But by being inclusive, are these groups actually exclusive?  Have you ever seen an event advertised and thought it looked great but then realised that you’re not the target market for the group?  How did this make you feel?  Happy that the marginalised community in question had a safe space, or slighted and wondering how they’d like it if you had a club just for people like you?

Would you agree that, mostly, people just want to be themselves?  Have you ever experienced a time where you felt you couldn’t?

**About the event**

This event is part of the ‘Feminist Approaches to Computational Technology: Read, Write, Code’ programme, supported by the [CHASE Doctoral Training Partnership](https://www.chase.ac.uk/prospectivestudent) and the Sussex Humanities Lab. This programme of work is co-led and co-organised by Dr Cécile Chevalier and Dr Sharon Webb as part of the [Feminist Approaches to Technology network (FACT///.)](http://fact.network/). FACT///.network was born from a desire to form and support a community around issues related to representation, diversity and inclusion within the broad area of computational practices (e.g. coders, DIY coders, programmers) and thinking. It seeks to create an active network and community that supports and encourage alternative demographics in current digital spaces, environments and practices from which computational thinking is made possible.

‘Mapping Feminists Coding Practices’, a one-day symposium at the Sussex Humanities Lab, University of Sussex, is the first in a series of events that explore feminist coding practices and the historic context of feminism and technology. It explores some of the affordances and resistances of computational technology. Its aim is to develop a wider understanding of current practices and research which make positive interventions into and within computation, in its widest possible interpretation, from a feminist perspective.
